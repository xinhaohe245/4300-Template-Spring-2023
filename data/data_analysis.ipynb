The associate behind the counter was very adamant that he is *not* going to accept it. When I asked why, he said 'because I am not going to accept it'. I told him he, and the store, is obliged to accept it according to the New York State Returnable Container Act. I told him that the store charges 5c for each container, and I have the right to get it back. He was absolutely rude about the return, tried to physically intimidate me by telling me to come closer to him, and raising his voice. At the very end, he told me he is not doing this because he's been working there for 5 years and no one ever asked for it.

I frequent this location as it is super convenient open all day which clearly leads to spending quite a bit. Pros: The store itself is gorgeous. It is super Convenient and open 24/7Cons: \\xa0The staff is actually impossible. I do not mind that there are employees, generally are not native English speakers. But if you have a situation where communication is difficult due to language barriers those employed MUST be adequately trained to deal with the product in the store and customer. The store Literally has items all over the place labeled improperly as the store I\\'m sure gets busy and people do not put items back in their proper places. Which is of course Understandable.This leads me to my experience tonight which has happened before but tonight was especially atrocious. There is a sale at this location for $20 off an item I was interested in. I asked numerous times for the amount for the item that was on sale (originally before the sale) and the amount of it\\'s counterpart which is a less expensive version of the Item on sale. These are very simple questions as I felt I needed to make a decision based on the price difference. Fast forward 10 minutes \"Sam \"the manager who made this name up and would not tell me his real name as he was completely wrong and knew it, not wanting to get in \"trouble\". Multiple times I was told different amounts for the same item from three different employees and REFUSED to simply read me what the SKU as I could not see it from where I was standing (it was behind the counter). As communication was difficult to begin with and each employee had told me different amounts for each item trying to tell me I\\'m \"getting a great deal\". I kid you not! After asking probably 10x what the SKU said as this would ensure I was not getting ripped off the guy finally rang up two items and still would not scan the SKU that clearly had the $20 off coupon. Again I couldn\\'t make this up as it\\'s ludacris. The guy wouldn\\'t scan the item that had the sale which was behind him and was clearly as frustrated as I was ... which in itself makes zero sense as he\\'s not the one spending money \\xa0I\\'m pretty sure it was my credit card being swipe not his. Consequently, I ended up buying an item that I knew the price prior and had to over pay for item that was not on sale because the employees were so poorly trained. My solution would be to have an employee or manager at the location at all times as this store that knows how to run a busy FIDI 24 hour a day convenient store & update and RE organize the items would make a HUGE difference.'),\n",

I went in & the nice hostess directed me to the bar where my bartender (John?) greeted me promptly & set down the menus which happened to be happy hour! I had an hour & a half to kill before my movie, so why not indulge?After 10 minutes of me deciding what I wanted to order, I went with a margarita & the Clubhouse Grille Sandwich with a side of waffle fries. The margarita was so refreshingly delicious & was hitting all the right spots, exactly what I needed. After about 15 minutes, someone from the kitchen comes out to tell John that they ran out of turkey & ham, the main ingredients of the entrée I had ordered. John then comes to me with the menus again to deliver the bad news. No problem! I'll see what else they have.Another 10 minutes of me studying the menu, I settled on the Crispy Bacon Chicken Ranch Sandwich with waffle fries. I added Swiss cheese & requested the crispy chipotle chicken breast (an ingredient from one of their other sandwiches) as opposed to the regular crispy one it comes with. With that, I ordered another drink, the Bahama Mama. It was so good! Just the right amount of rum to balance out those sweet flavours. Took me back to the Caribbean islands. About 20 minutes go by & my food finally gets here! John immediately noticed that the kitchen didn't add the Swiss cheese like I asked. He told me he can send it back so they can add it on. I had about 30 minutes left to kill & I was starving & just wanted to eat, so I declined & told him it was fine.The presentation looked like it was made in a hurry. I took a bite & it was so dry. =( They didn't use the crispy chipotle chicken breast like I had requested. I don't even know if they used the regular crispy one because it was not crispy at all! Also, where's the ranch? It's a CRISPY Bacon Chicken RANCH sandwich, no wonder she was so dry...I had not time to do this again, so I asked for a side of Bleu Cheese dressing to at least add some flavour to this bland dish.The waffle fries were not bad, they tasted great with the dressing. Gobbled those all up before I went in for a 2nd & final bite of the sandwich. It was just not registering with my taste palettes. It was just too dry (no ranch), too bland (no crispy chipotle seasoning), no cheese & just not at all what I ordered or anything like what I initially wanted.I had like 5 minutes left before my movie started, so I had to run out & had John close out my tab. He asked if I wanted a box for the food, & I would've taken that sandwich home & remixed tf out of it, but the cinema doesn't allow outside foods, so I couldn't. I really have to go now, my movie is starting...where's my ticket tho? I did order the movie/dinner combo, didn't I? I asked John about the ticket & he said he forgot to add it to the bill & that he would have to charge it separately.:::sigh:::Never mind man, it already started, I'm still here & I haven't even gotten movie snacks yet. I'll just go home with no movie after having paid $35 for 2 drinks & some fries. I ended up going somewhere else for food & drinks & skipped the film.Not for nothing, but McDonald's' chicken sandwich is WAY better & MUCH more flavourful--at a small fraction of the price.1 Star each for the drinks.\"),\n",

We took advantage of their kid's menu especial meals for $9.49 and their 1 appetizer and 2 full-size entrées for $24 especial. We ordered 2 kid's pizza with french fries, the pizzas were more like a piece of frozen bread with sauce and cheese, the kids mainly ate the fries and some of the cheese because it didn't taste that good. The other kid had a plain cheeseburger with french fries, it was good. My friend and I each had the Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp with a side Steamed Broccoli; it was so delicious but the chicken had way too much pepper, I \\xa0couldn't eat it because of it. The Mucho Cyclone Swirl Manarita was really good, we had one each, the price $7.00 was even better, lol. The service was great, Samantha, was amazing and very friendly with us and the kids.Unfortunately, the restaurant is still using regular plastic straws which are terrible for our environment so they lost 1 star for that. The other star was lost due to the excess of pepper on the chicken. Regardless, I would recommend this place and will visit it again.\"),\n",

We usually get that when we come here. \\xa0It\\'s always good. \\xa0The chips were very greasy, though! \\xa0For a drink, I had the specialty cocktail called Tipsy Reindeer. Vodka, cranberry juice, passion fruit, and lemon sour. Topped with a Santa gummie. \\xa0It was so good, huge, and only $6! \\xa0The food came out really fast. \\xa0Everything was fresh and delicious. \\xa0The mashed potatoes were real red potatoes and not the powdery, boxed stuff. Real cranberry sauce. Not the canned nastiness. \\xa0Fresh green beans. \\xa0They also brought out the slices of pumpkin pie with the meal. That\\'s when it started to feel like they were rushing us. \\xa0I mean, I get it. It\\'s Thanksgiving and you want to be home. \\xa0I don\\'t like pumpkin pie and they had no substitutions so I just took it to go. \\xa0We were checked on multiple times during our meal, which was nice, but also a bit annoying because I always had food in my mouth when we were asked if \"everything is good\". \\xa0All in all, we had a pretty good experience.
